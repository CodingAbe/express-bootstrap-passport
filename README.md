#  NodeJS and Boostrap 3 and Express 3 with Jade Templating, AKA "the full monte".  ;)

## This project was to setup a "real" vanilla express 3 build environment with the default Jade template engine and less compiling, etc.  In short, a fully operational launch point for an express 3 project.

## Prerequisites

I assume you have both node and git installed on your development system. Then:

- clone the repo: git clone https://dstroot@bitbucket.org/dstroot/exp-boot.git
- install the dependencies: npm install
- run the app: node app
